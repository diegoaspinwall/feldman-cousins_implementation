# feldman-cousins_implementation

This is a final project by Diego Aspinwall for PHYS524 at Yale University. This repo is intended to be submitted alongside the official writeup. The project goal, summarized:

> For my final project I will implement a tool for Feldman-Cousins statistical analysis of small signals, more specifically the special cases of bounded Gaussian error and Poisson processes with background noise. Alongside the tool I will submit a writeup where I describe my findings and design decisions. I will also be presenting on this topic.

To run this .ipynb file:

0. 'git clone' the repository
1. run all cells in 'feldman_cousins_implementation.ipynb'
2. it's as simple as that!

Note that since this code is deterministic, you should get the same results. Also note that this is a *basic* implementation and can be made more efficient and comprehensive.

Please see the code comments for further information and reach out to diego.aspinwall@yale.edu with any questions.
